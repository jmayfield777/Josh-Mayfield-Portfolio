# Josh-Mayfield-Portfolio

## Description

This webpage serves as a portfolio for Josh Mayfield's coding journey. When you view the page you will see a navbar with a title and navigation links to About Me, Work (currently placeholder images due to lack of real projects), and Contact sections. When viewed on a smaller screen, such as a cell phone, the nav bar collapses to a column and the links are pushed under the h1 header. The three sections also adapt to this specified width; the About Me section will fill the width of its container depending on screen size, the Work section changes from a wrapped flexbox row to a flexbox column, and the Contact links fill their container -- each section header is centered. When you hover over the placholder Work section links the size increases and a solid border appears around the img element. In addition, when you hover over the link elements in the navbar and the contact section a border-bottom appears and when active the color changes.
